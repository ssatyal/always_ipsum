# It's Always Ipsum in Philadelphia
## Lorem Ipsum from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
The purpose of the project was to create a lorem ipsum generator with quotes from the show. The quotes are ones I've hand picked from various episodes throughout the seasons. Once a user inputs the number of quotes (this defaults to five) and hits generate, a function randomizes a number and chooses that quote from the repository of quotes - rinse and repeat for the number of quotes to generate. The quotes are then handed back to the user.

## technical stuff
The limitations of hosting it on Github means that it's a front-end application only. The data is stored as JSON in the script file to mimic what it might look like in a NoSQL database or API.

## to-do
- optimize for mobile?
